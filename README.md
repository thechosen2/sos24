This is my project for SoS'24 conducted by MnP, on the topic Quantum Computing, Information, and Quantum technologies.

The material used to study this topic were mainly Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by M. Nielsen and I. Chuang, and The Qiskit Textbook, maintained by IBM.Consistent Quantum Theory by Robert J. Griffiths, which has a great chapter for linear algebra in Dirac notation, was also referred to for the initial portion.
